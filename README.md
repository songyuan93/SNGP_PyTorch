# SNGP_PyTorch
This code translate the original uncertainty-aware Deep Learning model called spectral normalized Nerual Gaussian Process (SNGP) to Pytorch. 

**Motivation** There are many SNGP pytorch model on GitHub, however they are barelly accomplished the same level of accuacy as the published tensorflow version. This version can perfectly repeat the result on the tensorflow version.
